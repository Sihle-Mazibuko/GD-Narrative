  clueName: File
  shortDescription: A file with Xolas information
  longDescription: This file seems to belong to the victim (Xola). Usually, files
    like this would be in a secure place that only someone of the highest authority
    would know the location, but here it has been discarded in the principles office.
    Maybe the principle needed information regarded Xola and forgot to put back the
    file or maybe someone used the file for other malicious intents.
