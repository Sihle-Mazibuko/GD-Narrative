  shortDescription: A pink purse
  longDescription: 'This purse was found in the same location as Linda. What is interesting
    about it is the red detailing which eerily resembles blood stains. And oddly
    enough purse belongs to Linda. This could easily have been in her possession
    when she murdered Xola, or the red detailing may be some sort of staining from
    another incident. '
