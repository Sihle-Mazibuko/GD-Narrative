  shortDescription: Thandos phone with a text about Xola
  longDescription: "This phone belongs to Thando, a \u201Ccompanion\u201D of Xola.
    On the phone, however, there is a text from Charlene stating that Xola had been
    gossiping and making rude remarks about Thando behind her back. It was noted
    that Thando dropped her phone in shock and rage-fuelled her to go find out where
    Xola is to address these accusations, but is this motive enough to kill her?"
