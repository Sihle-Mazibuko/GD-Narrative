  clueName: Drawing
  shortDescription: A weird drawing
  longDescription: In this drawing, we can see two women. It is hard to decipher
    what is happening however it seems as though one of the women is either sleeping,
    unconscious or dead while being held by the other woman. This could be a coincidence
    because how was this drawing made so quickly or a way of communicating that Xolas's
    murderer may have been a woman?
