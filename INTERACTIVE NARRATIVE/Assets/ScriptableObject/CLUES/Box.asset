  shortDescription: A ballot box
  longDescription: This ballet box contains the votes for the winner of the prom
    queens winner. On further evaluation Xola was found to be the winner with Linda
    trailing second. This can raise two suspicions to the killer as Linda could have
    done it out of spite but the only way she could have found out about the winner
    is through Charlene who was responsible for counting the votes. This raises suspicions
    on either of the two being the killer or having committed the crime together
