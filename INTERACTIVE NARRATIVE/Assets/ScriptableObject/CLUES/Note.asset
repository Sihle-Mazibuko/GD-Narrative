  shortDescription: An apology note from Musa to Xola
  longDescription: "This appears to be an apology letter from Musa to Xola. The two
    had recently fought over Musa's infidelity and this serves as a gesture of apologising
    to Xola and a way to try and fix things between the couple. In the letter, he
    details that he had a rough childhood that led to his actions, and he has anger
    issues that he has been trying to work on. Does this mean the letter failed and
    his anger took over him leading to killing Xola for the sake of \u201Cif I can't
    have you then no one can\u201D or did the letter never reach her entirely?"
