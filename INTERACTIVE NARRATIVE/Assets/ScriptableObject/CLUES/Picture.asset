  shortDescription: A picture of Xola with a cross
  longDescription: This was the same picture used for the voting system and by no
    surprise does it have an X over it. The person in the picture is Xola so could
    this be a discarded vote or a mark that the job has been finished? Charlene could
    know more about this as she is responsible for the votes, but this is an odd
    way to cast the vote because none of the other votes only had one option.
