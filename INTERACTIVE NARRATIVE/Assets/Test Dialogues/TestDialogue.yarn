Player: Can anyone confirm that?
Thando: I...I was hidden in the corner most of the time but sure?
Musa: (interrupts) Thando, you're not helping yourself here.
Player: Musa, do you know something about this?
Musa: No, I just... I just think she should have a better alibi.
Player: Let's get back to Thando. What were you doing "hidden in the corner"?
Thando: I'm shy, nothing special.

Player: Musa, where were you when Xola was murdered?
Musa: I was with some friends, you can ask them.
Player: Who are these friends?
Musa: Just some guys from school. I don't remember their names right now.
Player: That's convenient. Can anyone else vouch for you?
Musa: Look, I don't have to prove anything to you.
Thando: Detective, Musa is telling the truth.
Player: You seem pretty defensive, Musa. Is there something you're not telling me?
Musa: No, nothing at all. I'm just tired of these questions.

Player: Thando, I need you to come clean. What aren't you telling me?
Thando: I... I don't know what you mean.
Player: You were very quick to defend Musa. Are you covering for him?
Thando: No, I just know he didn't do it.
Player: How can you be so sure?
Thando: Because... because he was with me.
Player: So you weren't in the Hall?
Thando: No, we were together. Please don't tell anyone.
Player: This isn't looking good for either of you.
Musa: Thando, why did you say that?
Thando: I'm sorry, Musa. I couldn't keep lying.
